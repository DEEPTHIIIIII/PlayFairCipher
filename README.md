# PlayFairCipher
The Playfair Cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique that encrypts digraphs (pairs of letters) instead of single letters, making it more secure than traditional substitution ciphers.
Key Features:
5x5 Matrix: The cipher uses a 5x5 matrix of letters generated from a keyword, where the letters 'I' and 'J' are usually combined to fit the alphabet.
#Encryption Rules:
Same row: Shift both letters to the right.
Same column: Shift both letters downward.
Rectangle: Swap the letters to form a rectangle.
Add a filler character (usually 'X') if letters in the same pair are identical or if thereâ€™s an odd number of letters.
Decryption follows similar rules but shifts left or upward instead of right or downward.
